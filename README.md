# RF & Clocking System for Wireless Front-End

## Description
Design an **RF receiver front-end** integrated with **PLL-based clocking**. Students will learn to combine **RF design, PLLs, and clock distribution networks** to create a complete receiver system.

## Base Projects Used
- [RF-design-of-1.9-GHz-Rx-frontend](https://github.com/muhammadaldacher/RF-design-of-1.9-GHz-Rx-frontend)  
- [RF-design-of-2.4-GHz-LNA](https://github.com/muhammadaldacher/RF-design-of-2.4-GHz-LNA)  
- [Analog-Design-of-1.9-GHz-PLL-system](https://github.com/muhammadaldacher/Analog-Design-of-1.9-GHz-PLL-system)  
- [Analog-Design-of-Clock-Distribution-Network-using-Standing-Waves](https://github.com/muhammadaldacher/Analog-Design-of-Clock-Distribution-Network-using-Standing-Waves)  

## Learning Outcomes
- Design LNAs, mixers, and frequency synthesizers
- Tune PLL loop filters, VCOs, and compare LC vs ring VCOs
- Implement standing-wave clock distribution networks
- Integrate RF frontend with ADC or digital interface
- Simulate channel interference and robustness

## Tweaks & Extensions
- Change RF target band (e.g., Bluetooth 2.4 GHz â†’ WiFi 5 GHz)  
- Add **adaptive biasing** for LNA power efficiency  
- Integrate PLL clocking with ADC sampling  
- Explore RF + mixed-signal system simulations
