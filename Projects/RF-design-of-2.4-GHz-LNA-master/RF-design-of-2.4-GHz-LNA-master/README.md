# RF-design-of-2.4-GHz-LNA
This project is about building a high FOM 2.4 GHz LNA for Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Standards, using 45nm CMOS technology. A comparison was done between a single -stage Common-Source LNA & a cascode LNA in terms of performance (the required Noise Figure (NF), the S11, the Gain, & the Power consumption). Also, using Smith Charts, a matching network is chosen at the inputs of the LNAs to match the LNAs input to the source's 50 Ohm impedance.
